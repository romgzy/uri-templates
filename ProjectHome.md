URI Templates allow you to leave parts of a URI to be filled in by a client before the are used, e.g.:
```
   http://example.org/{userid}
```

See [RFC6570](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) for more information.

This project contains the materials used to produce some of the pre-RFC drafts, as well as some accompanying code used to prove parts of the RFC.

Please join the [W3C URI mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/) to participate in the discussions about URI Templates.

### Implementations ###

The Python implementation started here has been moved to a [github project](https://github.com/uri-templates/uritemplate-py).

We also maintain a wiki page with a list of [implementations](Implementations.md) of the URI Template spec.
